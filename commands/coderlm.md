Use the coderlm skill to explore the codebase with tree-sitter-backed indexing. The skill provides precise symbol extraction, cross-file caller detection, test discovery, and scope-aware grep.

Start with `init` to create a session, then use `structure`, `search`, `impl`, `callers`, `tests`, `grep`, and `peek` to navigate the code. See `.claude/skills/coderlm/SKILL.md` for the full workflow.
