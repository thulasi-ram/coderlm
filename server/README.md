# coderlm-server

A Rust-based code-aware REPL server for the CoderLM Recursive Language Model system. It indexes codebases on-demand, extracts symbols via tree-sitter, and exposes a JSON API that agents query for targeted context — structure, symbols, source, callers, tests, grep, and more.

Zero files are created inside the target repository. The server runs externally, watches the filesystem for changes, and supports multiple simultaneous agent sessions across multiple projects.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain** (rustc 1.70+). Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
  ```
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
- **A C compiler** (gcc/clang) — required by tree-sitter's native code generation.
  ```
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install build-essential

  # macOS (Xcode command line tools)
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## Building

```bash
cd server/
cargo build --release
```

The binary is at `target/release/coderlm-server`.

To install it into your PATH:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Start the server (no project path required — projects are registered on-demand)
coderlm-server serve

# Or pre-index a specific project at startup
coderlm-server serve /path/to/your/project

# Verify it's running
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/health
```

Output:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "projects": 0,
  "active_sessions": 0,
  "max_projects": 5
}
```

Create a session to start working with a project:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cwd":"/path/to/your/project"}'
```

The server indexes the project directory (if not already known) and returns a `session_id`. All subsequent API calls use this session ID via the `X-Session-Id` header to scope queries to that project.

## CLI options

```
coderlm-server serve [PATH] [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  [PATH]  Optional path to pre-index at startup

Options:
  -p, --port <PORT>                  Port to listen on [default: 3000]
  -b, --bind <ADDR>                  Bind address [default: 127.0.0.1]
      --max-file-size <BYTES>        Skip files larger than this [default: 1000000]
      --max-projects <N>             Maximum concurrent indexed projects [default: 5]
```

## Logging

Control log verbosity with the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
# Default (info)
coderlm-server serve

# Debug logging (shows per-file symbol extraction)
RUST_LOG=debug coderlm-server serve

# Quiet (warnings and errors only)
RUST_LOG=warn coderlm-server serve
```

## Managing multiple projects

A single server instance supports multiple projects simultaneously. Projects are registered automatically when an agent creates a session with a `cwd` pointing to that project. No manual setup is needed.

### How it works

1. Agent creates a session: `POST /sessions` with `{ "cwd": "/home/user/myproject" }`
2. Server indexes the directory (file tree scan + background symbol extraction + filesystem watcher)
3. Session is scoped to that project — all queries only see that project's files and symbols
4. Multiple agents can connect to different projects on the same server

### Example: two repos, one server

```bash
# Start the server
coderlm-server serve --port 3000

# Agent A connects to the backend
SESSION_A=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cwd":"/home/user/backend"}' | jq -r .session_id)

# Agent B connects to the frontend
SESSION_B=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cwd":"/home/user/frontend"}' | jq -r .session_id)

# Each agent only sees its own project
curl -H "X-Session-Id: $SESSION_A" localhost:3000/api/v1/structure  # backend files
curl -H "X-Session-Id: $SESSION_B" localhost:3000/api/v1/structure  # frontend files
```

### Capacity and LRU eviction

The server keeps at most `--max-projects` projects indexed at once (default: 5). When a new project would exceed this limit, the **least recently used** project is evicted — its file tree, symbols, and filesystem watcher are dropped, and all sessions pointing to it are cleaned up. Agents using those sessions will receive `410 Gone` responses and can simply create a new session to re-index.

```bash
# Allow more concurrent projects
coderlm-server serve --max-projects 10
```

### Admin visibility

Check which projects are currently indexed:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/api/v1/roots
```

Returns each project's path, file count, symbol count, last active time, and session count.

List all active sessions:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/api/v1/sessions
```

View command history across all sessions (no `X-Session-Id` needed):

```bash
curl localhost:3000/api/v1/history
```

### Recommendations

- **One server is enough.** Projects are auto-registered on session creation. No need to run separate instances per repo.
- **Annotations are per-project.** File definitions, symbol definitions, and marks set by one session are visible to all sessions on the same project. This lets a swarm of agents build shared understanding.
- **Filesystem watcher is automatic.** When you edit files in a project, the server detects changes within ~500ms and re-indexes. No restart needed.
- **Stopping a server loses annotations.** Definitions and marks are in-memory only. They are rebuilt from scratch on restart. A future version may persist them to disk.

## Supported languages (tree-sitter)

Symbol extraction (functions, classes, structs, methods, etc.) is available for:

| Language   | Extensions                    |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Rust       | `.rs`                         |
| Python     | `.py`, `.pyi`                 |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx`                 |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` |
| Go         | `.go`                         |

All other file types are indexed in the file tree and available for peek/grep/chunk operations, but do not produce symbols.

## API overview

All endpoints are under `/api/v1`. Data endpoints require `X-Session-Id` header to scope queries to a project.
